# Lerian Matcher

**Matcher** is Lerian Studio's reconciliation engine. It automates transaction matching between [Midaz](https://github.com/LerianStudio/midaz) (Lerian's ledger) and external systems — banks, payment processors, ERPs — applying configurable matching rules, managing exceptions through workflow integrations, and maintaining a complete audit trail for compliance.

## Why Matcher?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Automated Matching** | Reduce manual reconciliation with deterministic rules, tolerance-based matching, and confidence scoring |
| **Configurable Rules** | Define exact and tolerance-based rules, date windows, fee verification, and multi-source matches |
| **Exception Workflows** | Route unresolved items to JIRA, ServiceNow, or webhooks where teams already work |
| **Audit-First** | Append-only audit logging with hash chains for SOX-ready traceability |
| **Multi-Tenant** | Schema-per-tenant isolation in PostgreSQL with JWT-based tenant resolution |
| **Runtime Configurable** | Hot-reloadable settings via systemplane API — no restarts for tuning |

## Reconciliation Pipeline

Matcher implements a complete reconciliation pipeline:

1. **Configure** — Define reconciliation contexts, sources, field maps, match rules, and fee schedules
2. **Ingest** — Import external data (CSV, JSON, XML, ISO 20022), normalize fields, deduplicate
3. **Match** — Execute deterministic and tolerance-based matching, produce match groups with confidence scores
4. **Handle Exceptions** — Classify unmatched items, route to teams, record manual resolutions
5. **Govern** — Maintain immutable audit log, verify hash chain integrity, archive for compliance
6. **Report** — Dashboard analytics, variance analysis, export to CSV/PDF

## Architecture

Matcher is a **modular monolith** built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD), hexagonal architecture, and CQRS-light separation.

### Bounded Contexts

| Context | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Configuration** | Reconciliation contexts, sources, field maps, match rules, fee schedules/rules, scheduling |
| **Discovery** | External data source connection management, schema detection, extraction orchestration |
| **Ingestion** | File parsing (CSV/JSON/XML/ISO 20022), normalization, BOM handling, Redis-based dedup |
| **Matching** | Rule execution, confidence scoring (0-100), fee verification, manual match/unmatch, adjustments, cross-currency |
| **Exception** | Exception lifecycle, disputes with evidence tracking, bulk operations, external dispatch |
| **Governance** | Immutable audit logs, cryptographic hash chain verification, S3 archival |
| **Reporting** | Dashboard metrics, async export jobs (CSV/PDF), streaming reports, Redis caching |

### Technical Highlights

- **Hexagonal Architecture** — Ports and adapters per bounded context with strict import boundaries
- **Schema-Per-Tenant** — PostgreSQL `search_path` isolation with JWT-derived tenant identity
- **Transactional Outbox** — Reliable event publication for ingestion and matching workflows
- **Fee Schedule Engine** — Net-to-gross normalization with parallel and cascading fee application
- **Distributed Locking** — Redis-based locks preventing concurrent match runs
- **Cross-Currency Matching** — FX rate lookups and base-currency normalization
- **Idempotency** — Redis-backed idempotency keys for safe client retries
- **Systemplane** — Runtime configuration authority with hot-reloadable settings and inline schema metadata via the current admin API
- **Chaos Testing** — Toxiproxy-based fault injection for resilience validation
- **OpenTelemetry** — Distributed tracing and metrics via lib-observability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.26.3](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) (for database migrations)

### 1. Clone and Start Infrastructure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LerianStudio/matcher.git
cd matcher
export SYSTEMPLANE_SECRET_MASTER_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n')"
make up
```

This starts PostgreSQL (primary + replica), Valkey (Redis-compatible), RabbitMQ, SeaweedFS (S3), and the app with live reload.

### 2. Apply Migrations

```bash
make migrate-up
```

### 3. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:4018/health
# Returns plain text "healthy" or HTTP 503
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:4018`. Swagger UI is accessible at `http://localhost:4018/swagger/index.html` when running in non-production mode.

### Configuration

No configuration file is required for most local defaults. Docker Compose still requires `SYSTEMPLANE_SECRET_MASTER_KEY`; export it in your shell or define it in local `config/.env` before running `make up`.

For production, override via environment variables. See [`config/.config-map.example`](config/.config-map.example) for bootstrap-only keys (require restart). Runtime hot-reload is limited to systemplane-managed settings (for example: body limit, rate limits, worker intervals, feature flags, timeouts, export settings, and archival intervals) via `/system/matcher/:key` (`GET`/`PUT`) and `/system/matcher` (list with inline schema metadata). The admin API is a management-plane surface and is intentionally excluded from the public OpenAPI specification.

### Deployment Notes

**GOMEMLIMIT (Go memory hint).** The image does not set `GOMEMLIMIT`. Operators must configure it per-deployment at roughly 85% of the container memory limit (for example, `GOMEMLIMIT=425MiB` for a 500 MiB pod). Go 1.26 auto-detects cgroup CPU via `GOMAXPROCS` but does **not** auto-detect cgroup memory; leaving `GOMEMLIMIT` unset risks OOM-kills from an uncapped Go heap. Kubernetes example:

```yaml
env:
  - name: GOMEMLIMIT
    valueFrom:
      resourceFieldRef:
        resource: limits.memory
        divisor: "1"
```

### Testing

Matcher uses TDD (Test-Driven Development) with four test tiers:

- **Unit** (`make test`): Pure logic tests with mocks — no external dependencies
- **Integration** (`make test-int`): Real containers via testcontainers
- **E2E** (`make test-e2e`): Full-stack journey tests against running services
- **Chaos** (`make test-chaos`): Fault injection with Toxiproxy (latency, connection loss, partitions)

Coverage threshold: **70%**, enforced in CI.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `develop` (e.g., `feat/my-feature`)
3. **Follow conventions**: Run `make lint && make test && make check-tests` before pushing
4. **Submit a PR** to `develop` with a conventional commit title and a description of at least 50 characters

### PR Requirements

- Conventional commit format in PR titles (e.g., `feat: add batch matching endpoint`)
- Every `.go` file must have a corresponding `_test.go`
- Test build tags required (`//go:build unit`, etc.)
- Run `make generate-docs` if you changed any API endpoint

### Code Standards

- Go 1.26 with 75+ linters enforced
- Hexagonal architecture: adapters, ports, domain, services
- CQRS separation: `*_commands.go` for writes, `*_queries.go` for reads
- Multi-tenancy via JWT context — never accept tenant IDs from request parameters
- Error wrapping with `%w`, UTC timestamps, parameterized SQL queries

For detailed conventions, see [`docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`](docs/PROJECT_RULES.md).
