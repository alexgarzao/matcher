# Project Rules

Architectural constraints and design decisions for the Matcher codebase. This project follows Lerian Studio Ring standards for Go services.

## 1. Architecture

- Modular monolith with 7 bounded contexts under `internal/{context}` (configuration, discovery, ingestion, matching, exception, governance, reporting). Outbox is NOT a bounded context; it is a cross-cutting infrastructure concern wired in `internal/bootstrap/outbox_wiring.go` via the lib-commons v5 canonical dispatcher (see §1 Shared Kernel and `internal/shared/ports/outbox.go`).
- Hexagonal Architecture per context:
  - `adapters/`: infrastructure and transports (HTTP, DB, MQ).
  - `domain/`: pure business logic and entities.
  - `ports/`: interfaces for external dependencies.
  - `services/`: application use cases (command/query/worker).
- CQRS separation: write in `services/command/`, read in `services/query/`.
- Command use-case files end with `_commands.go`; query files end with `_queries.go`. Helper files with private methods may use descriptive names without the suffix.
- Domain entities remain pure logic (no logging/tracing). Enforced by `domain-no-logging` depguard rule.
- Keep domain models rich: enforce invariants in entities/value objects, not in adapters.
- Entities must expose state transitions via methods; avoid direct status mutation in services/adapters.
- Constructors validate invariants and return `(*T, error)` when creation can fail.
- Use value objects/enums with `Valid`/`IsValid` + parse helpers for critical types.
- Defensive copy caller-owned maps/slices before storing in entities.
- Identity fields (`ID`, `ContextID`, `TenantID`, `SourceID`) are immutable after creation.
- Domain invariants use `pkg/assert`; validation tags are only for inbound DTOs.
- **Nil checks vs asserters**: Use simple `if x == nil` for nil receiver checks, dependency injection (with sentinel errors), and adapter layer. Use `pkg/assert` for domain entity invariant validation and business rule validation with structured context.
- Avoid cross-context adapter imports; depend on ports instead.
- Avoid panics in all production paths.
- Only change infra/config (Docker, compose, env templates) in explicit DevOps tasks.

### Shared Kernel

- `internal/shared/` is the designated bridge between bounded contexts. Types needed by multiple contexts live here. Cross-context imports are blocked by depguard.
- **Interface location convention**:
  - `domain/repositories/` for a context's own aggregate store interfaces.
  - `ports/` for external dependency abstractions (EventPublisher, ObjectStorage, CacheProvider).
  - `internal/shared/ports/` for cross-context abstractions (OutboxRepository, AuditLogRepository, InfrastructureProvider, MatchTrigger, TenantLister, FetcherClient, M2MProvider, IdempotencyRepository).
- **Domain subdirectory variations**: `domain/value_objects/` (configuration, exception, ingestion, matching), `domain/enums/` (matching), `domain/errors/` (governance only).
- **Type-alias pattern**: When a type migrates to `shared/domain/`, the original package re-exports via type alias for backward compatibility.
- **Worker directories**: `services/worker/` for ticker-based background jobs (configuration scheduler, governance archival, reporting export/cleanup, discovery bridge/custody/poller workers). Workers own a lifecycle (Start/Stop + Redis distributed lock) and are wired in `internal/bootstrap/` alongside use cases.
- **Syncer directories**: `services/syncer/` for on-demand domain synchronization helpers imported by both commands and workers. Currently used only by discovery (`services/syncer/syncer.go` — connection schema cache synchronization). Distinct from `services/worker/` because a syncer is a callable helper, not a background lifecycle. Do not introduce a syncer in a context where a single worker or use case suffices.
- **Outbox dispatcher**: Provided by `lib-commons/v5/commons/outbox`. Wired in `internal/bootstrap/outbox_wiring.go`; matcher registers one handler per event type on the canonical HandlerRegistry instead of hosting its own dispatcher package.
- **Cross-context communication**: Via shared ports, outbox events, and cross adapters in `internal/shared/adapters/cross/`. Current cross adapters: auto_match, configuration, exception_context_lookup, exception_matching_gateway, ingestion, matching, transaction_repository.

## 2. Required Libraries

- **AuthN/AuthZ**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-auth/v2` (`v2.8.0`).
- **Commons**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-commons/v5` (latest v5.x; currently v5.2.1) for non-observability infrastructure utilities.
- **Observability**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-observability` (`v1.0.0`) for logging, tracing helpers, metrics factory, assertions, and panic recovery.
- **Assertions**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-observability/assert` (no panics; referred to as `pkg/assert` in shorthand).
- **Streaming**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-streaming` (`v1.5.0`) for producer-only CloudEvents, event catalog, manifest, and streaming outbox relay support.
- **lib-commons submodules**:
  - Database: `commons/postgres` (`libPostgres`).
  - Redis: `commons/redis` (`libRedis`).
  - Messaging: `commons/rabbitmq` (`libRabbitmq`).
  - HTTP utilities: `commons/http` (`libHTTP` — ParseBodyAndValidate, Respond, CursorPagination, idempotency).
- **lib-observability submodules**:
  - Tracking/logging: root package (`libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext`) and `log` (`libLog`).
  - OpenTelemetry helpers: `tracing` (`libOpentelemetry`).
  - Metrics: `metrics` (`libMetrics`).
  - Panic recovery: `runtime` (`runtime.RecoverAndLogWithContext`, `runtime.SafeGoWithContextAndComponent`).
- **Runtime config**: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-systemplane` (`v1.1.0`) as the sole runtime configuration authority after bootstrap.
- **Key third-party**: `gofiber/fiber/v2` (HTTP), `Masterminds/squirrel` (SQL builder), `shopspring/decimal` (amounts), `google/uuid` (IDs), `go-playground/validator/v10` (DTO validation), `codeberg.org/go-pdf/fpdf` (PDF generation).
- Do not introduce custom DB/Redis/MQ clients outside lib-commons wrappers.

## 3. Context + Observability

- Always use `libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext(ctx)` for logger/tracer/header data.
- Start a span per service method: `ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "{context}.{operation}")` and `defer span.End()`.
- Service span naming: `{context}.{operation}` (e.g., `matching.run_match`, `configuration.create_context`).
- Handler span pattern: `ctx, span, logger := startHandlerSpan(fiberCtx, "handler.{context}.{operation}")` + `defer span.End()`.
- Error reporting: `libOpentelemetry.HandleSpanError(span, "message", err)` — takes **value** not pointer.
- Business error events: `libOpentelemetry.HandleSpanBusinessErrorEvent(span, "message")` for non-critical domain errors.
- Error sanitization: `libLog.SafeError(logger, ctx, "msg", err, productionMode.Load())`.
- Structured logging: `logger.With(libLog.String("key", "val")).Log(ctx, level, "msg")`.
- Ensure adapters handle nil tracers/loggers gracefully (provide fallbacks) for testing contexts.
- Do not log inside domain entities/value objects.

### SetSpanAttributesFromValue: Redactor Contract

When calling `libOpentelemetry.SetSpanAttributesFromValue(span, name, value, redactor)`
to attach a struct payload to a span, the 4th argument is a `*Redactor` from
`github.com/LerianStudio/lib-observability/tracing`. Matcher today passes `nil` at all 35+
call sites because the payloads used are synthetic query descriptors composed
of already-scoped field names (context_id, limit, cursor) — they contain no
PII, credentials, or tenant-bearing secrets.

This `nil`-by-default is conditional on payload purity. When a new call site
introduces any of the following into its attached struct, a non-nil Redactor
with explicit field masking MUST be passed:
  - plaintext tenant identifiers beyond the ID/slug already in tracking
  - user-supplied free-text (filter values, search queries, comments)
  - credentials, tokens, or any field stored encrypted at rest
  - third-party payloads (e.g., Fetcher bridge responses)

CI does not enforce this contract today. Reviewers must check the 4th
argument during PR review whenever a new `SetSpanAttributesFromValue` call
site is added or an existing struct is extended. Consider adding a custom
linter to `tools/linters/observability` if the call-site count grows
materially (>100) or if a sensitive field leaks into a span attribute.

### /readyz 250ms response cache (K8s probe amplification dampening)

Matcher's `/readyz` handler caches its rendered response for 250ms to dampen Kubernetes probe amplification — five probes per second across many pods would otherwise hammer Postgres/Redis/RabbitMQ connection pools with redundant health checks when nothing has changed.

Invariants:

- **Cache TTL = 250ms.** See `readyzCacheTTL` in `internal/bootstrap/health_check.go` line 342.
- **Wall-clock cap = 900ms** (under kubelet's default 1s probe budget). See `readyzHandlerWallClockCap` in `internal/bootstrap/health_check.go` line 337.
- **Drain short-circuit bypasses the cache.** When `drainingGetter()` returns `true` (SIGTERM received, in-flight requests draining), the handler skips the cache entirely and returns 503 immediately. See `internal/bootstrap/health_check.go` lines 281-289.
- **Per-handler cache instance** — mounting a new handler (e.g. in tests) always starts with an empty cache.

This deviates from Ring's default "always recompute health" guidance, but is justified under probe-amplification-in-K8s conditions. **Do not extend the cache beyond 250ms without load-testing justification**, and do not remove the drain short-circuit — a pod that is draining must report unhealthy on the very next probe, not up to 250ms later.

## 4. HTTP Handler Patterns

- Framework: Fiber v2 (`gofiber/fiber/v2`).
- Handler constructor validates dependencies (nil checks with sentinel errors).
- Every handler starts with `ctx, span, logger := startHandlerSpan(fiberCtx, "handler.{context}.{operation}")` + `defer span.End()`.
- Body parsing: `libHTTP.ParseBodyAndValidate(fiberCtx, &payload)`.
- Context verification: `libHTTP.ParseAndVerifyTenantScopedID()` for path params with tenant ownership validation.
- Error-to-HTTP mapping: use `errors.Is(err, ErrSentinel)` to map domain errors to HTTP status codes.
- Response formatting: `libHTTP.Respond(fiberCtx, status, body)`, `libHTTP.RespondError(fiberCtx, status, title, message)`, `libHTTP.RespondStatus(fiberCtx, status)`.
- Swagger annotations required on all handlers (`@Summary`, `@Tags`, `@Param`, `@Success`, `@Failure`, `@Router`).
- Route registration uses `protected(resource, actions...)` higher-order function wrapping auth + tenant + idempotency + rate limiting.
- Production mode: `atomic.Bool` (`productionMode`) controls error detail exposure via `SafeError`.

## 5. Service Use Case Patterns

- One UseCase struct per bounded context (command and query are separate structs).
- Required dependencies validated in constructor with sentinel errors; optional deps via functional options (`UseCaseOption`).
- Method naming: domain-specific (e.g., `RunMatch()`, `ManualMatch()`, `CreateContext()`), NOT generic `Execute()`.
- Input structures: single struct per method (e.g., `RunMatchInput`, `AdjustEntryInput`).
- Every method starts with: `logger, tracer, _, _ := libCommons.NewTrackingFromContext(ctx)` + `ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "{context}.{operation}")` + `defer span.End()`.
- Put logic in entities when it only needs entity fields; use services for multi-aggregate or external dependency coordination.
- Keep services small and single-responsibility.
- Prefer explicit state (enums) over implicit derivation for critical domain status.

## 6. Repository Patterns

- Use `pgcommon.WithTenantTxProvider(ctx, provider, fn)` for new transactions with automatic tenant schema isolation.
- Use `pgcommon.WithTenantTxOrExistingProvider(ctx, provider, existingTx, fn)` for composable transactions (accepts optional caller-owned tx).
- Every write method must have a `WithTx` variant (enforced by custom linter `repositorytx`).
- Three-layer pattern: public `Create()` -> public `CreateWithTx()` -> private helper.
- Model / domain conversion: separate PostgreSQL model structs from domain entities, with `NewPostgreSQLModel()` and `ToEntity()` methods.
- Use `squirrel` for dynamic query building with `squirrel.Dollar` placeholder format.
- Cursor-based pagination via `pgcommon.ApplyIDCursorPagination()` with limit+1 pattern.
- `InfrastructureProvider` interface provides tenant-aware transaction and database access (`BeginTx`, `GetPrimaryDB`, `GetReplicaDB`, `GetRedisConnection`). Callers MUST release DB and Redis leases when finished.

## 7. Data + Multi-tenancy

- **CRITICAL**: Tenant info (`tenantID`, `tenantSlug`) must ONLY come from JWT claims via context.
  - NEVER accept tenant identifiers in request payloads, path params, query params, or custom headers.
  - Repository methods extract tenant from context via `auth.GetTenantID(ctx)`, never as function parameters.
  - This prevents tenant spoofing attacks.
- Apply schema via `auth.ApplyTenantSchema(ctx, tx)` inside transaction helpers.
- If tenant claims missing and auth disabled, run in single-tenant mode.
- Default tenant uses `public` schema (no UUID schema created). Background workers MUST include default tenant explicitly when enumerating tenants via `pg_namespace`.
- Read operations use replica connections with connection-scoped `SET search_path`.
- Transaction timeout: 30s default when context has no deadline.

## 8. Error Handling Patterns

- Sentinel errors defined at 5 locations:
  - `services/command/commands.go` — use case sentinels.
  - `domain/entities/*.go` — state transition errors.
  - `adapters/postgres/{name}/errors.go` — repository sentinels.
  - `adapters/http/errors.go` or `handlers.go` — HTTP-level errors.
  - `domain/errors/errors.go` — governance only.
- All sentinels follow `Err[Category][Specific]` naming (e.g., `ErrMatchGroupMustBeProposedToConfirm`).
- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` — always `%w`, never `%v`. Enforced by forbidigo.
- Cross-context error re-export via type alias: `ErrTenantIDRequired = sharedDomain.ErrAuditTenantIDRequired`.
- No structured error types — all `errors.New()` sentinels.

## 9. Worker Patterns

- Workers live in `services/worker/` (scheduler, archival, export, cleanup, discovery worker, Fetcher bridge worker, custody retention worker, and extraction poller runner).
- Ticker-based polling with configurable interval.
- Redis distributed lock (`SetNX` with TTL = 2x interval) prevents concurrent runs across instances.
- Graceful shutdown: `atomic.Bool` for running state, `sync.Once` for stop, channels for signal-based shutdown.
- Panic recovery: `defer runtime.RecoverAndLogWithContext(ctx, logger, component, name)` MUST be first defer (LIFO order matters).
- Re-entrant: `prepareRunState()` allows Start/Stop/Start cycles.
- Runtime config updates: only when stopped (`UpdateRuntimeConfig`).

## 10. Idempotency

- Middleware applied after auth + tenant extraction (needs tenant ID for key scoping).
- Key sources: explicit header (`X-Idempotency-Key` / `Idempotency-Key`) OR SHA-256 of request body.
- Key validation: max 128 chars, alphanumeric + colons/underscores/hyphens.
- State machine: PENDING -> COMPLETE (cached response replayed with `X-Idempotency-Replayed: true`) or FAILED (reacquirable).
- 409 Conflict when request in progress.

## 11. Redis Usage

- Distributed locking: `matcher:matchrun:lock:{contextID}` with Lua-verified release.
- Transaction deduplication: hash of `sourceID:externalID`, Redis SETNX with TTL (via `ingestion/adapters/redis/dedupe_service.go`).
- Idempotency cache: response caching for duplicate request detection.
- Dashboard caching: Redis-backed cache for reporting dashboard metrics.
- All keys tenant-scoped via `valkey.GetKeyFromContext()` (lib-commons tenant-manager).

## 12. RabbitMQ + Outbox Pattern

- All async communication via outbox pattern (no direct context-to-context messaging).
- Outbox dispatcher: polling interval configurable (~2s default), batch processing, max retry attempts.
- Per-tenant event processing with schema isolation.
- `ConfirmablePublisher`: broker confirmation + automatic channel recovery with exponential backoff.
- Dead-letter queue for failed messages.

## 13. Database

- PostgreSQL 17 with schema-per-tenant isolation.
- Repositories mirror patterns in `internal/configuration/adapters/postgres`.
- SQL queries must respect tenant isolation.
- Add indexes for join/filter keys in migrations.
- Keep migrations additive; avoid destructive changes in production.
- Enforce referential integrity with foreign keys where applicable.
- Avoid long-running transactions; keep write paths short and deterministic.
- Prefer read replicas for query services via `GetReplicaDB`.
- Migration validation: `make check-migrations` verifies pairs (up/down) and sequential numbering via `scripts/check-migrations.sh`.
- Migration naming: `000001_descriptive_name.up.sql` / `000001_descriptive_name.down.sql`.
- Currently 32 migrations (000001 through 000032).

## 14. Testing

### Build Tags

Build tags are the **authoritative** test type discriminator (required at top of file):

| Tag | Scope | External deps |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| `//go:build unit` | Unit tests | None (mocks only) |
| `//go:build integration` | Integration tests | Testcontainers |
| `//go:build e2e` | End-to-end tests | Full stack |
| `//go:build chaos` | Fault injection | Toxiproxy + containers |

### Frameworks + Helpers

- **Assertions**: `testify` (assert/require).
- **SQL mocking**: `DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock`.
- **Containers**: `testcontainers-go` with `wait.ForAll(ForLog, ForListeningPort)` for health.
- **Interface mocking**: `go.uber.org/mock` (gomock) for complex contracts; manual mocks for simple interfaces (5 or fewer methods).
- **Chaos**: `Shopify/toxiproxy/v2` for fault injection (latency, reset, timeout, packet loss).
- **Test helpers**: `testutil.NewMockProviderFromDB()`, `testutil.NewClientWithResolver()`, `testutil.NewRedisClientWithMock()`.

### Patterns

- TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR) required. Every commit should include tests.
- Integration pattern: `sync.Once` singleton containers per package, not per test.
- E2E pattern: fluent factory builders (e.g., `f.Context.NewContext().WithName("test").OneToOne().MustCreate(ctx)`), HTTP client per domain.
- Chaos pattern: Toxiproxy proxies per service (PG, Redis, RabbitMQ), fault injection methods.
- Coverage threshold: **70%** enforced in CI via shared workflow.
- `make check-tests` ensures every `.go` file has a corresponding `_test.go`.
- `make check-test-tags` verifies test files have proper build tags.
- No tests should rely on external services unless marked integration.
- Makefile unsets all matcher config env vars before test runs (`CLEAN_ENV`).

### Test File Naming

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `{name}_sqlmock_test.go` | SQL mock-based unit tests |
| `{name}_mock_test.go` | Other mock-based unit tests |
| `{name}.postgresql_test.go` | Postgres adapter tests (build tag discriminates unit vs integration) |
| `{name}_coverage_test.go` | Explicit coverage-focused tests |
| `{name}_coverage_sqlmock_test.go` | Coverage + sqlmock combined |

Do NOT merge test files when consolidating source files.

### `t.Parallel()` in Integration Tests

Integration tests under `tests/integration/**` and `internal/**/*_integration_test.go` are permitted to call `t.Parallel()` even though Ring's default policy discourages parallel integration tests. Matcher's integration harness is safe for parallel execution because:

1. `sync.Once` guards container-once-per-suite setup (see `tests/integration/shared_harness.go`).
2. Each test gets an isolated PostgreSQL schema via tenant-scoped setup, so concurrent tests do not share table state.
3. Redis/RabbitMQ contention is bounded by per-test key prefixes.

Removing `t.Parallel()` categorically would extend CI wall-clock by ~8x with no correctness benefit.

**Policy:** `t.Parallel()` IS allowed in matcher's integration tests. Unit tests MUST NOT call `t.Parallel()` (Ring default applies).

### Integration Test Location

Most integration tests live under `tests/integration/**` and use the shared harness (`tests/integration/shared_harness.go`).

**Exception:** `internal/discovery/**/*_integration_test.go` stays co-located inside the discovery package. These tests exercise the Fetcher bridge worker with purpose-built fixtures — an httptest Fetcher impersonator emitting contract-locked HMAC + IV headers, a MinIO custody bucket testcontainer, and in-package access to the worker's unexported `pollCycle` helper. Moving them under `tests/integration/discovery/` would force the helper to be exported (widening the surface area of an internal API) and duplicate the bridge-specific fixtures, with no correctness or maintainability benefit.

**Policy:** New integration tests should default to `tests/integration/`. Co-location is only justified when tests require access to unexported helpers or use purpose-built fixtures that do not compose with the shared harness.

### Integration Test Fixtures

Integration test fixtures (`createTest*` / `newTest*` / `seedTest*` / `wireServices` helpers) live per-context in `tests/integration/{context}/helpers_test.go` rather than a centralized `tests/utils/fixtures.go`. Rationale:

1. Matcher's bounded contexts enforce import isolation via depguard rules. Centralizing fixtures would force `tests/utils/` to import from every context, re-coupling what production code deliberately keeps separate.
2. Per-context fixtures encode domain knowledge — `runMatchAndGetGroup` (matching) knows the match-group aggregate structure, `createExceptionForTransaction` (exception) knows the exception lifecycle, `seedTestConfig` (exception) and `seedE4T9Config` (matching) seed different aggregates even when their signatures look similar.
3. Deduplication pressure is low. A survey across the four `helpers_test.go` files (matching, exception, flow, reporting) found only a handful of genuinely identical helpers (`mustRedisConn`, `buildCSV`, `countInt`, `noopIngestionPublisher`). The rest are semantically distinct.

**When to promote a helper to shared scope:** Only if the fixture is genuinely context-agnostic — e.g. tenant-header generation, JWT builders, time/UUID fakes. Cross-context helpers of that kind already live in `tests/integration/shared_harness.go` (tenant + harness setup) and `internal/testutil/` (`Ptr[T]`, deterministic time). A new shared helper must add value to at least three contexts and avoid importing any bounded-context domain types.

## 15. File Naming Conventions

### Postgres Adapter Files

Every aggregate-based postgres adapter directory uses Pattern A:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `{name}.go` | Model structs, domain-to-DB conversions |
| `{name}.postgresql.go` | Repository implementation |
| `errors.go` | Adapter-specific sentinel errors |

**Flat layout exceptions**: `reporting/adapters/postgres/` (read-only projections), `shared/adapters/postgres/common/` (utilities), `governance/adapters/postgres/` (audit_log, no model file).

### Command/Query Service Files

- Use plural suffix: `*_commands.go`, `*_queries.go`.
- Entity-grouped: each `*_commands.go` contains ALL write operations for an aggregate/entity group.
- Entry point: `commands.go` or `queries.go` (UseCase struct, constructor, shared errors/sentinels).
- Helper files: private methods may use descriptive names without suffix (e.g., `match_group_persistence.go`, `rule_execution_support.go`, `match_group_lock_commands.go`). The suffix is required for files exposing public use-case methods.

### Handler Splitting

Split into `handlers_{feature}.go` when a context has 3+ distinct feature areas (e.g., `handlers_run.go`, `handlers_manual.go`, `handlers_adjustment.go`).

### DTO Directory

`adapters/http/dto/` with files like `{entity}.go`, `requests.go`, `responses.go`, `converters.go`, `doc.go`.

## 16. Tooling

### Required Make Targets

| Category | Targets |
|----------|---------|
| Core | `dev`, `build`, `tidy`, `clean` |
| Quality | `lint`, `lint-fix`, `lint-custom`, `lint-custom-strict`, `format`, `sec`, `vet`, `vulncheck` |
| Testing | `test`, `test-unit`, `test-int`, `test-e2e`, `test-e2e-fast`, `test-e2e-journeys`, `test-e2e-discovery`, `test-e2e-dashboard`, `test-chaos`, `test-leak`, `test-all` |
| Coverage | `cover`, `coverage-unit`, `check-coverage` |
| Checks | `check-tests`, `check-tests-self`, `check-test-tags`, `check-migrations`, `check-license`, `check-generated-artifacts` |
| Generation | `generate`, `generate-casdoor`, `generate-docs` |
| Docker | `docker-build`, `up`, `down`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `rebuild-up`, `clean-docker`, `logs` |
| Migration | `migrate-up`, `migrate-down`, `migrate-to`, `migrate-create`, `migrate-version`, `migrate-force` |
| CI | `ci` |

- Test runner: `gotestsum` if available, else `go test`.
- Docker Compose command auto-detected (`docker compose` vs `docker-compose`).

### Zero-config convention

Matcher does **not** ship a `.env.example` file, and `docker-compose.yml` does **not** use `env_file:`. Instead, `config/.config-map.example` is the single source-of-truth reference for environment variables.

Rationale:

1. **Bootstrap provides sensible defaults for most keys** (`internal/bootstrap/config_defaults.go`). Docker Compose still requires `SYSTEMPLANE_SECRET_MASTER_KEY` to be supplied through the shell, deployment pipeline, or local `config/.env` before startup.
2. **A single reference file is simpler than keeping `.env.example` + `env_file:` + bootstrap defaults in sync.** Three parallel lists of env vars drift apart; one canonical reference does not.
3. **Operators who need overrides set env vars directly** — via their deployment pipeline, Helm values, or local shell. They do not need a template file; they read `config/.config-map.example` as documentation.

**Do not create `.env.example`.** When adding a new bootstrap-only configuration key, update `config/.config-map.example` instead.

This deviates from Ring's default `.env.example` + `env_file:` pattern, but is justified by the zero-config-defaults stance. See also `docker-compose.yml` (no `env_file:` directive, but a fail-fast required `SYSTEMPLANE_SECRET_MASTER_KEY`) and `internal/bootstrap/config_defaults.go` (the single source of defaults).

## 17. Linting

### Standard Linters (golangci-lint)

Run with `make lint`. Configuration in `.golangci.yml`. 75+ linters enabled.

**Key enforced rules:**

- **Multi-tenancy security**: Never accept tenant identifiers in request payloads, path params, or query params. Use `auth.GetTenantID(ctx)`.
- **UTC timestamps**: Always `time.Now().UTC()`.
- **SQL injection prevention**: Parameterized queries (`$1, $2, ...`), never `fmt.Sprintf` with `%s` for SQL.
- **Error wrapping**: `%w` not `%v` with `fmt.Errorf`.
- **Import organization**: stdlib -> third-party -> Lerian libs -> project (enforced by `gci`).
- **Stricter formatting**: `gofumpt` (superset of `gofmt`).

### forbidigo Security Patterns

| Blocked pattern | Replacement |
|----------------|-------------|
| `panic`, `log.Panic*`, `log.Fatal*`, `os.Exit` | Return errors (exemptions: `main.go`, `pkg/runtime`, test helpers) |
| `fmt.Print*` | Structured logging (exemptions: `cmd/`, `pkg/assert/`, tests) |
| `.Params("contextId")`, `.Query("contextId")` | `sharedhttp.ParseAndVerifyContextParam()` |
| `json:"tenant_id"`, `.Params("tenantId")`, `.Query("tenant...")` | `auth.GetTenantID(ctx)` |
| `time.Now()[^.]` | `time.Now().UTC()` |
| `fmt.Sprintf(...%s...SQL...)` | Parameterized queries |
| `fmt.Errorf(...%v...err)` | `fmt.Errorf(...%w...err)` |
| `runtime.SafeGoWithContext` (without Component) | `runtime.SafeGoWithContextAndComponent(...)` |

### depguard Architectural Rules

| Rule | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `http-handlers-boundary` | HTTP handlers cannot import postgres adapters for bounded contexts with HTTP adapters |
| `cross-context-{name}` (x7) | Full cross-context isolation for all bounded contexts |
| `service-no-adapters` | Services cannot import adapter packages; depend on ports |
| `dto-no-services` | DTOs cannot import service packages |
| `worker-no-adapters` | Workers cannot import postgres/redis/rabbitmq adapters directly |
| `cqrs-command-isolation` | Command services cannot import query packages |
| `cqrs-query-isolation` | Query services cannot import command packages |
| `domain-purity` | Domain services cannot import application or adapter packages |
| `domain-no-logging` | Domain layer cannot depend on logging/tracing/infrastructure |
| `ports-no-adapters` | Ports cannot import adapters (dependency inversion) |
| `entity-purity` | Entities cannot import repositories or `database/sql` |
| `shared-adapters-boundary` | Shared adapters use shared kernel, not context-specific entities |
| `cross-adapter-output` | Cross adapters import domain types only, not HTTP adapters |
| `testutil-isolation` | Test utilities cannot depend on production adapters |

### Custom Linters

Run with `make lint-custom`. Source in `tools/linters/`.

| Linter | Enforces |
|--------|----------|
| `entityconstructor` | `New<EntityName>(ctx, ...) (*EntityName, error)` pattern |
| `observability` | `NewTrackingFromContext` + span creation + `defer span.End()` |
| `repositorytx` | Write methods (`Create`, `Update`, `Delete`) have `*WithTx` variants |
| `determinism` | Advisory check for non-deterministic time/UUID usage in entity-construction tests |
| `goroutineleak` | Strict-mode check for packages that spawn goroutines without goleak-backed `TestMain` coverage |

### IDE Integration

VSCode settings in `.vscode/settings.json` configure golangci-lint as the linter, gofumpt as the formatter, and format/organize imports on save.

## 18. CI/CD

All CI uses shared workflows from `LerianStudio/github-actions-shared-workflows`.

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|

- Go version: module `go 1.26.3` (in `go.mod`); CI and Dockerfile pinned to `1.26.3`. golangci-lint v2.10.1.
- Coverage threshold: 70%, enforced via `fail_on_coverage_threshold: true`.

## 19. Docker

- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build. `golang:1.26.3-alpine` (builder) -> `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` (runtime).
- Separate `/health-probe` binary for distroless healthchecks (30s interval, 5s timeout, 3 retries).
- Migrations copied to both `/migrations` and `/components/matcher/migrations` for lib-commons PostgresConnection.
- **docker-compose services**:

| Service | Image | Port |
|---------|-------|------|
| postgres | `postgres:17` | 5432 |
| postgres-replica | `postgres:17` | 5433 |
| redis | `valkey/valkey:8` | 6379 |
| rabbitmq | `rabbitmq:4.1.3-management-alpine` | 5672, 15672 |
| seaweedfs | `chrislusf/seaweedfs:3.80` | 8333, 9333 |
| app | `golang:1.26.3-alpine` (air dev) | 4018 |

- All infrastructure services have healthchecks. App container depends on all infra services being healthy.

## 20. Dependency Maintenance Notes

### PDF Generation: `codeberg.org/go-pdf/fpdf`

- **Migration**: `github.com/go-pdf/fpdf` v0.9.0 → `codeberg.org/go-pdf/fpdf` v0.11.1 (Feb 2026). GitHub repo archived March 2025; same maintainers, identical API on Codeberg.
- **Scope**: `internal/reporting/services/query/exports/pdf.go` only.

### Core Runtime Dependency Refresh Policy

- **Scope**: Infrastructure/runtime upgrades (framework, logging, telemetry, messaging, networking, and datastore clients) must be treated as operationally sensitive.
- **Soak policy**: Stage for at least 7 days with `make test-int`, `make test-e2e-fast`, and readiness/health probes validated under representative load.
- **Rollback plan**: Keep a tested rollback path (revert dependency bump or pin previous known-good versions in `go.mod`), run `go mod tidy`, then re-run `make test` + `make test-int` before redeploy.
- **Owner**: Platform/Runtime maintainers must sign off rollout and rollback readiness during review.

## 21. Object Storage

- S3-compatible object storage for exports (CSV/PDF) and governance archives.
- SeaweedFS used in development (`docker-compose.yml`).
- Exports use presigned URLs for secure download.
- Archive integrity verified with checksums during archival and retrieval.
- Configuration via `OBJECT_STORAGE_*` and `ARCHIVAL_STORAGE_*` env vars.
- Functional options pattern via `internal/shared/ports` (`UploadOption`, `WithStorageClass`, `WithServerSideEncryption`) for operation customization.

## 22. Systemplane (Runtime Configuration)

- Bootstrap-only keys (require restart): See `config/.config-map.example`.
- Runtime keys: hot-reloadable via API, no restart needed.
- API endpoints (canonical lib-systemplane admin surface, management-plane only; intentionally excluded from public OpenAPI): `GET /system/matcher` (list with inline schema metadata), `GET /system/matcher/:key` (read a single key), `PUT /system/matcher/:key` (write a single key). The previous `/v1/system/configs[...]` paths and the `/schema`, `/history`, `/reload` sub-endpoints are not part of the current lib-systemplane admin surface. Reference: `github.com/LerianStudio/lib-systemplane/admin`.
- Key definitions in `internal/bootstrap/systemplane_keys_*.go`.
- Reconcilers in `internal/bootstrap/systemplane_reconciler_*.go` apply changes to running components.
- Never read Viper directly at runtime — use `configManager.Get()` which returns systemplane-backed config.

## 23. Misc

- Avoid one-letter variable names unless required.
- Do not add inline comments unless requested.
- `atomic.Bool` for thread-safe production mode flag in handlers.
- Lease pattern for all DB/Redis connections (automatic cleanup via `Release()`).
- Avoid duplicating domain concepts between shared kernel and contexts; pick a single source of truth and map explicitly.
- Put logic in entities when it only needs entity fields; use domain services for multi-aggregate or external dependency coordination.
- Import order: stdlib -> third-party -> Lerian libs (`lib-auth`, `lib-commons`) -> project (`internal/`, `pkg/`).
