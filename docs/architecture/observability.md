# Observability

## Metrics: OTLP Push, not Prometheus Scrape

Matcher ships metrics via **OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) push** to a configured collector. Matcher does **not** expose a Prometheus `/metrics` scrape endpoint.

### Why push, not scrape

1. **Single observability pipeline.** Traces, logs, and metrics all ship through the same OTLP endpoint — configurable via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`. Operators manage one integration point, not two.
2. **Tenant-aware metric enrichment.** Matcher records tenant attributes explicitly on tenant-aware metrics and propagates trace context through the OpenTelemetry request context. The OTLP exporter transports those attributes; it does not add them automatically.
3. **No leaked metrics endpoint.** Matcher's HTTP surface stays API-only. There is no `/metrics` route to secure against scrapers that would otherwise need careful tenant-context handling.
4. **No per-pod scrape config.** Each Matcher pod pushes telemetry to the configured OTLP collector endpoint. Prometheus scrape configs would need to keep up with pod lifecycle.

### If a reviewer asks "where's /metrics"

Point them here. A Prometheus-compatible scrape surface CAN be added later — via `otel-collector`'s Prometheus exporter on the push side of the pipeline — but that is a **deployment decision**, not an application-code decision. Matcher itself stays push-only.
