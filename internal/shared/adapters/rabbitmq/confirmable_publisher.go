// MIGRATION(lib-commons): ConfirmablePublisher Migration Plan
//
// This type is a candidate for promotion to lib-commons/v5/commons/rabbitmq so
// that all Lerian services (Matcher, Midaz, and future services) can share a
// single, battle-tested publisher-confirms implementation.
//
// # Prerequisites (all must be met before migration)
//
//   - API stability: The ConfirmablePublisher API must be stable for at least
//     two release cycles (no breaking option or method signature changes).
//   - Test coverage: Unit test coverage must be >= 90%, including recovery edge
//     cases (partial failures, jitter determinism, concurrent recovery+publish).
//   - Feature completeness: Automatic channel recovery (exponential backoff,
//     health callbacks, configurable max attempts) must be implemented and
//     validated in production within the Matcher service first.
//   - Documentation: Godoc examples for all public types and option functions.
//
// # Features to add during migration
//
//   - Batch confirms: A PublishBatch method that publishes N messages and waits
//     for all confirmations in a single round-trip, reducing latency for
//     high-throughput scenarios (e.g., outbox dispatcher draining 100+ events).
//   - Metrics integration: Expose confirm latency histograms, nack counters,
//     and recovery attempt counters via OpenTelemetry metrics (not just logs).
//   - Connection-level recovery: In addition to channel recovery, support
//     full connection re-establishment when the AMQP connection itself drops.
//   - Builder API: Consider a fluent builder pattern instead of functional
//     options if the option count grows beyond 8-10 (readability trade-off).
//
// # Breaking changes to consider
//
//   - The ConfirmableChannel interface may need additional methods (e.g.,
//     IsClosed() bool) for health probing. Adding methods is a breaking change
//     for external implementors.
//   - The ChannelProvider function type signature may evolve if connection-level
//     recovery is added (it may need to accept a context or return a connection).
//   - Package path changes: lib-commons uses commons/rabbitmq as the base
//     package. Sentinel errors would move and importers must update.
//
// # Migration trigger
//
//   When 2+ Lerian services need reliable publisher confirms (Matcher already
//   does; if Midaz or another service adopts outbox+RabbitMQ), begin the
//   migration. File an issue in lib-commons with a link to this comment.

// # Channel Isolation
//
// Each ConfirmablePublisher MUST own a dedicated AMQP channel. AMQP publisher
// confirms are channel-scoped: calling Confirm(false) resets the delivery tag
// counter and confirmation state. If two publishers share the same channel, the
// second Confirm call will invalidate the first publisher's confirmation tracking,
// leading to silent message loss. Always open a new channel (e.g., via
// RabbitMQConnection.GetNewConnect()) for each publisher instance.
//
// # Reconnection
//
// ConfirmablePublisher supports two reconnection modes:
//
// Manual reconnection: When auto-recovery is not configured, channel closure
// causes all Publish calls to return ErrPublisherClosed. Callers must detect
// this error and call Close() followed by Reconnect(newChannel) manually.
//
// Automatic recovery: When configured via WithAutoRecovery, the publisher
// detects channel closure and automatically attempts to obtain a new channel
// from the provided ChannelProvider. Recovery uses exponential backoff with
// jitter and emits health state changes via the optional HealthCallback.
// During recovery, Publish calls return ErrPublisherClosed until a new channel
// is successfully established.
